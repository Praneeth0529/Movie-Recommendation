# Movie Recommender System

This project implements a **Movie Recommender System** using Python. The system suggests movies similar to a specified movie based on a preprocessed dataset. The project is encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand and modify.

## Overview

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a simple, yet effective movie recommendation system that provides users with a list of movies similar to a movie they input. This can be useful for exploring new films or finding alternatives to well-known titles.

### How It Works

The recommender system works by matching the input movie title with a dataset of movies and providing recommendations based on predefined similar movies. The recommendations are displayed in the output of the Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **IPython Widgets**: For interactive UI elements within the Jupyter Notebook.

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas ipywidgets
